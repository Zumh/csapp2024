- Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, to Minneapolis,
Minnesota, a total distance of 2,500 kilometers. 
- You estimate you can average 100 km/hr driving within the speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.
- Aside Expressing relative performance old old
- Tnew=(1−α)Told+(αTold)/k=Told[(1−α)+α/k]
- old new S=1(1−α)+α/k (1.1)
- The best way to express a performance improvement is as a ratio of the form T /T , 
- where T is the time required for the original version and T is the time required by the modified version. 
- This will be a number greater than 1.0 if any real improvement occurred. 
- We use the suffix `×' to indicate such a ratio, where the factor "2.2×" is expressed verbally as "2.2 times."
- The more traditional way of expressing relative change as a percentage works well when the change is small, but its definition
- is ambiguous. Should it be 100 · (T − T )/T , or possibly 100 ·
- (T − T )/T , or something else? In addition, it is less instructive for large changes. 
- Saying that "performance improved by 120%" is more difficult to comprehend than simply saying that the performance improved by 2.2×.
- A. You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit, which constitutes 1,500 km of the trip. 
- Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr. 
- What will be your speedup for the trip?
- B. You can buy a new turbocharger for your truck at www.fasttrucks.com. 
- They stock a variety of models, but the faster you want to go, the more it will cost. 
- How fast must you travel through Montana to get an overall speedup for your trip of 1.67×?

## Solution
**Practice Problem 1.1 Solution**

Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, a total distance of 2,500 kilometers. You estimate you can average 100 km/hr driving within the speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.

**A. You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit, which constitutes 1,500 km of the trip. Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr. What will be your speedup for the trip?**
 
The time it takes to travel through Montana is 1,500 km / 100 km/hr = 15 hours. The time it takes to travel through the rest of the trip is 2,500 km - 1,500 km = 1,000 km, which will take 1,000 km / 100 km/hr = 10 hours.

The total time for the trip with the speed limit is 15 hours + 10 hours = 25 hours. The total time for the trip without the speed limit is 1,500 km / 150 km/hr = 10 hours + 10 hours = 20 hours. Therefore, the speedup for the trip is 25 hours / 20 hours = 1.25 times.

**B. Suppose that this part of the trip is 60% of the time and that you could improve the performance of this part by a factor of k. How much (i.e., what value of k) would you need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target of a speedup of 1.67 times?**

Let's denote the time it takes to travel through Montana, which is 60% of the trip, as T. We know that the overall speedup for the trip is 1.67 times, which means that the total time for the trip with the improvement is 25 hours / 1.67 times = 15 hours.
- Montanana trip distance 1,500 km
- The rest of the trip is still in speed limit so it will still take 10 hr
- And only montanna should take 5 hr
- montana + the rest of the trip = 15 hr
- k = montana distance / time it take to travel  = 1500km/5hr
- k = 300 km/hr must be the speed for traveling within montannna

Therefore, to get an overall speedup for the trip of 1.67 times, you must travel through Montana at 300 km/hr.
