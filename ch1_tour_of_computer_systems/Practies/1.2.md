The marketing department at your company has promised your
customers that the next software release will show a 2×
performance improvement. You have been assigned the task of
delivering on that promise. You have determined that only 80% of

the system can be improved. How much (i.e., what value of k)
would you need to improve this part to meet the overall
performance target?
One interesting special case of Amdahl's law is to consider the effect of
setting k to ∞. That is, we are able to take some part of the system and
speed it up to the point at which it takes a negligible amount of time. We
then get
So, for example, if we can speed up 60% of the system to the point
where it requires close to no time, our net speedup will still only be 1/0.4
= 2.5×.
Amdahl's law describes a general principle for improving any process. In
addition to its application to speeding up computer systems, it can guide
a company trying to reduce the cost of manufacturing razor blades, or a
student trying to improve his or her grade point average. Perhaps it is
most meaningful in the world of computers, where we routinely improve
performance by factors of 2 or more. Such high factors can only be
achieved by optimizing large parts of a system.
