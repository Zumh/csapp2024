## Summary of Representing and Manipulating Information

**Integer Representations**
* Binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representation systems
* Signed and unsigned integer types
* Range of representable integers

**Integer Arithmetic**
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder operations
* Overflow and underflow conditions
* Two's-complement representation
* Bitwise Boolean operations

**Floating Point**
* IEEE floating-point format
* Normalized, denormalized, special, and infinity values
* Rounding modes
* Floating-point arithmetic properties (associativity, commutativity)
* Gradual underflow and overflow

**Summary**
This chapter presents a foundational understanding of how information is represented and manipulated on a computer, focusing on binary representation and operations on integers and floating-point numbers. The principles of the IEEE floating-point format are particularly emphasized.
