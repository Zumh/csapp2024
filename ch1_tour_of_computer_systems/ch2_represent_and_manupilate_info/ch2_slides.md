## Binary
- **The base 2 numbering system, also known as the binary system, is a mathematical system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1.** It's used in digital computers to represent data and perform calculations.

- In the binary system, each digit represents a power of 2, with the least significant digit representing 2^0, the next digit representing 2^1, and so on. For example, the binary number 1011 represents the decimal number 11 because:

`1 × 2^3 + 0 × 2^2 + 1 × 2^1 + 1 × 2^0 = 11`

- The binary system is used in computers because it's easy to implement electronically, with each digit being represented by a single transistor or logic gate.
