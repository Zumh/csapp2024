## Ahmdal Law
- Speedup = 1 / [(1 - P) + (P / N)]
### Practice Problem 1.1
- Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, a total distance of 2,500 kilometers.
- You estimate you can average 100 km/hr driving within the speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.

#### Aside

- Expressing relative performance old old Tnew=(1−α)Told+(αTold)/k=Told[(1−α)+α/k] old new S=1(1−α)+α/k (1.1)

- The best way to express a performance improvement is as a ratio of the form T /T , where T is the time required for the original version and T is the time required by the modified version.
- This will be a number greater than 1.0 if any real improvement occurred. We use the suffix '×' to indicate such a ratio, where the factor "2.2×" is expressed verbally as "2.2 times."
- The more traditional way of expressing relative change as a percentage works well when the change is small, but its definition is ambiguous.
- Should it be 100 · (T − T )/T , or possibly 100 · (T − T )/T , or something else? In addition, it is less instructive for large changes.
- Saying that "performance improved by 120%" is more difficult to comprehend than simply saying that the performance improved by 2.2×.

A. You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit, which constitutes 1,500 km of the trip. Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr. What will be your speedup for the trip?

B. You can buy a new turbocharger for your truck at [www.fasttrucks.com](http://www.fasttrucks.com). They stock a variety of models, but the faster you want to go, the more it will cost. How fast must you travel through Montana to get an overall speedup for your trip of 1.67×?
