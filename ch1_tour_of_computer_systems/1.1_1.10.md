## 1.1 Information Is Bits + Context
- Chapter 1.1 of the document  discusses the fundamental concept that information is represented by bits and context.
- Bits are the basic unit of information in a computer system, and they can have a value of either 0 or 1.
- By themselves, however, bits are meaningless. It is the context in which they are used that gives them meaning.
- For example, a sequence of eight bits could represent a character, an instruction code, or a data value, depending on the context in which it is used.
- In essence, information is a combination of bits and the context that interprets those bits.

## 1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
- Programs are translated by other programs into different forms. This process is broken down into two main stages: compilation and linking.

- In the compilation stage, a program written in a high-level language, such as C or C++, is translated into assembly language. Assembly language is a low-level language that is specific to a particular processor architecture. The compiler reads the source code of the high-level language program and generates an assembly language program as output.

- In the linking stage, the assembly language program is translated into machine code. Machine code is the lowest-level language that a computer can understand and execute directly. The linker combines the assembly language program with any necessary library code to create a final executable program.

- This process of translation allows programmers to write programs in high-level languages that are easier to understand and maintain than machine code. The compiler and linker then take care of the complex task of translating these programs into a form that the computer can execute.â–‘
