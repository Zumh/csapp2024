### Chapter 9 Virtual Memory

**Why Virtual Memory?**

- Traditional systems require the entire program to be loaded in physical memory before execution. This limits program size and the number of concurrent processes.
- Virtual memory separates the logical address space (how the program sees memory) from the physical address space (actual physical memory).

**Benefits of Virtual Memory:**

- **Run larger programs:** Programs can be larger than physical memory because only active parts are loaded.
- **Increased multiprogramming:** More processes can reside in memory partially, improving system utilization.
- **Efficient process creation:** Virtual memory simplifies memory allocation during process creation.
- **Memory protection:** Isolates processes, preventing them from interfering with each other's memory.
- **Simplified memory management:** Presents a contiguous address space to the programmer, even if memory is fragmented physically.
- **Shared memory:** Allows processes to share memory pages efficiently.

**Key Concepts in Virtual Memory:**

- **Demand Paging:** Only load memory pages (fixed-size blocks) when they are referenced, reducing unnecessary I/O and memory usage.
- **Page Replacement Algorithms:** When physical memory is full, the OS needs to decide which page to evict to make room for a new one. Common algorithms include FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
- **Allocation of Frames:**  Defines how many page frames (physical memory blocks) a process gets. 
- **Thrashing:**  An inefficient situation where the OS spends too much time swapping pages in and out of memory. The chapter discusses how to identify and avoid thrashing.
- **Memory-Mapped Files:** Allows efficient access to files by mapping them directly into a process's virtual address space.

The chapter also explores concepts like the working-set model, kernel memory management, and considerations for specific operating systems.

### Chapter 10 System Level I/O

**System Calls for File I/O**

* Linux provides basic file I/O functions based on the Unix I/O model. These functions allow applications to:
    * Open and close files
    * Read from and write to files
    * Get file metadata
    * Perform I/O redirection

* Short counts: Reads and writes might return less data than requested due to various reasons. Applications need to handle short counts correctly.

**The RIO Package**

* To simplify I/O operations, the RIO package is recommended over directly using Unix I/O functions.
* RIO automatically handles short counts by repeatedly reading or writing until all requested data is transferred.

**Data Structures for Open Files**

* The Linux kernel uses three main data structures to manage open files:
    * Descriptor table: Each process has its own descriptor table containing entries pointing to entries in the open file table.
    * Open file table: Shared by all processes, this table contains entries pointing to entries in the v-node table.
    * V-node table: Shared by all processes, this table stores information about actual files.

**Understanding these structures is crucial for file sharing and I/O redirection.**

**Standard I/O Library**

* The standard I/O library sits on top of Unix I/O and offers a set of higher-level routines for file I/O.
* For most applications, standard I/O is the preferred choice due to its simplicity.

**Network Applications and I/O**

* Standard I/O and network files have limitations that can cause incompatibility.
* For network applications, Unix I/O is recommended over standard I/O due to its better compatibility.

### Chapter 11 Network Programming
**Client-Server Model**

* Every network application relies on the client-server model.
* In this model, a server manages resources and provides services to clients.
* Clients request data or actions from the server, and the server responds.

**The Internet: A Programmer's View**

* The internet is seen as a collection of devices (hosts) with unique 32-bit IP addresses.
* Domain names offer a friendlier way to reference these IP addresses.
* Applications on different devices can connect and communicate.

**Sockets: Communication Endpoints**

* Clients and servers use sockets to establish connections. 
* A socket acts like a file descriptor for an application to read and write data during communication.

**Web Servers and HTTP Protocol**

* Web browsers (clients) and web servers communicate using the HTTP protocol.
* Browsers can request static content (files) or dynamic content generated by programs on the server.

**Serving Dynamic Content (CGI)**

* The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) defines how browsers pass information to servers to generate dynamic content.
* The server executes a program to create the content and sends it back to the browser.

**Implementing a Simple Web Server**

* With a few hundred lines of code, a basic web server can handle both static and dynamic content using CGI.

### Chapter 12 Concurrent Programming

**Building Concurrent Programs**

This chapter explores three main approaches to building concurrent programs:

1. **Processes:** Processes are independent units of execution with separate address spaces. They require special mechanisms (IPC) to communicate and share data.
2. **I/O Multiplexing:** This approach creates event-driven programs with state machines. It uses I/O multiplexing to manage concurrent flows within a single process, allowing for fast data sharing.
3. **Threads:** Threads offer a compromise between processes and I/O multiplexing. They are scheduled by the kernel but share the same address space as a process, enabling efficient data sharing.

**Synchronization and Semaphores**

Regardless of the chosen mechanism, concurrent programs face the challenge of synchronizing access to shared data. This chapter introduces semaphores (P and V operations) as a tool to manage shared data access. Semaphores can:

*  Ensure mutually exclusive access (only one thread at a time) to shared data.
*  Control access to limited resources, like buffers or readers/writers scenarios.

**Thread Safety and Common Issues**

Concurrency introduces additional complexities:

* **Thread Safety:** Functions used by multiple threads must be thread-safe. The chapter identifies four types of thread-unsafe functions and suggests ways to make them thread-safe.
* **Reentrant Functions:** A special type of thread-safe function that doesn't rely on synchronization as it avoids using shared data. They can be more efficient.
* **Races:** These occur due to incorrect assumptions about how concurrent flows are scheduled, leading to unpredictable behavior.
* **Deadlocks:** A situation where threads are waiting for resources held by each other, preventing progress.

The chapter concludes by highlighting these challenges and the importance of careful design and coding practices for concurrent programs.
